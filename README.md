# Discohands

Democratically and anonymously choose topics to discuss.

## Dependencies

Node dependencies can be installed with `npm install`. Discohands also
depends on these services:

 - [Redis](http://redis.io)
 - [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org)
 - [Google OAuth 2.0](http://console.developers.google.com)

## Configuration

Discohands is configured through environment variables, or by a
`config.json` file in the same directory as `app.js`.

 - `NODE_ENV`: Run in `production` or `development` mode. Default
   `development`.
 - `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret key for stored sessions. Default "keyboard
   cat".
 - `MAXIMUM_TOPIC_AGE_DAYS`: Optional number of days after which a topic is omitted. Default is no omission due to topic age.   
 - `REDIS_URL` or `REDISCLOUD_URL`: Redis connection URL. Default
   `redis://localhost:6379`.
 - `MONGODB_URI` or `MONGOLAB_URI`: MongoDB connection URI. Default
   `mongodb://localhost/discohands`.
 - `ROOT_URL`: Root URL Discohands will be available at. Used for OAuth
   callback URL. Default `http://localhost:8080`.
 - `AUTHORIZED_DOMAIN`: Domain emails must be from in order to log in.
   Default `gmail.com`.
 - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth 2.0 client ID.
 - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth 2.0 client secret.

Google OAuth 2.0 credentials can be obtained through the [Google
Developers Console](http://console.developers.google.com) by creating a
new project, then creating a client ID under "APIs & auth",
"Credentials". The redirect URIs should be set to the Discohands root
URL `/auth/google/callback`.

## Development

```
node app
```

Google OAuth 2.0 credentials are required in development.
`http://localhost/auth/google/callback` can be configured as a valid
redirect URI in Google Developers Console.

## Deployment

Discohands can easily be deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) with
[Redis Cloud](https://addons.heroku.com/rediscloud) and
[MongoLab](https://addons.heroku.com/mongolab).
